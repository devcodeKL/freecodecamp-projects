# FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository

Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository! This repository houses projects related to the FreeCodeCamp's Core Curriculum and serves as a practice ground for completing assignments and challenges from the curriculum.

## About

The projects in this repository are part of my ongoing self-practice and study journey to enhance my skills in web development through the FreeCodeCamp Core Curriculum. They cover various topics such as Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms, and Data Structures.

## How to Use

Each project has its own directory with instructions on how to run or view the project. Feel free to explore and use these projects for your own learning purposes.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to FreeCodeCamp for providing such a comprehensive and structured curriculum and learning platform.
